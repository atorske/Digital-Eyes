		  <p>Embedded pictures of various extremely recognizable buildings</p>
		  <p>One future addition to the 'Digital Eyes' application will be to
		  make it portable.  The first step is to implement the application so that it 
		  runs smoothly with the Microsoft Tags in the tagged SEC building on the campus
		  of the University of Alabama.  However, once the application works well we
		  plan to implement a graphical user interface for the application.  This 
		  interface will allow the user to download our application and easily modify
		  it.  This will allow the application to become portable as the interface will
		  allow the user to add maps of their own buildings. It will also allow the addition
		  of the microsoft tags and descriptions of the locations the tags relate to to
		  be added to the application.  Once this is done the application will be able to take this 
		  information and direct the user around the tagged building. 
		  </p>
		  <p>This addition will make the application much more relevant in the real world. 
		  There might not be overwhelming need for this application in one building 
		  on one college campus, however, with this addition the application could be 
		  theoretically used in any building, anywhere.  Provided there is someone willing
		  to tag the building, which is not too difficult, as all that would be required is 
		  uploading maps and printing free Microsoft Tags, the application could be used 
		  anywhere. This will greatly expand the application's sphere of influence, and 
		  possible user base.  This expansion has the potential to greatly help those
		  with visual disabilities become more independent.
