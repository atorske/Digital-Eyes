		  Those with visual disabilities might not be able to see dangerous locations
		  inside of buildings.  With 'Digital Eyes' they will no longer have to worry.
		  Another future expansion of the application is to add warnings to the features
		  that the applicatin offers.  This could include any and all possible dangers
		  <img src="./images/28.jpg" class="warning_size" style="float: right;" >
		  the tagger of a building notices and will be fully customizable to any and all
		  possible dangers.  The warning will be able to be input into the phone using 
		  the existing speech to text we include, or a customized mp3 message can be 
		  uploaded for use in that building. 
		  
		  </p>
		  </br>
		  <p>
		  
		  Dangers inside of buildings could range from open stairwells, which since they
		  <img src="./images/200_Caution_Stairs_warning_sign.jpg" class="warning_size2" style="float: left;"> 
		  cannot be seen could cause a nasty fall. The application will warn users with
		  verbal alerts and vibrates of stationary dangers of this type as they approach 
		  the danger zone. Other possible dangers include those warned about signs posted,
		  <img src="./images/646877_saf.jpg" class="warning_size2" style="float: right; padding-left:0px;">
		  for example, on the walls. These include, but certainly are not limited to, 
		  dangerous chemicals, necessity of protection, for things such as a chemistry lab
		  where there are posted warning signs which the visually disabled would not be
		  able to see, or even realize that they exist. 
		  
		   The application will tell the user
		  as they enter the building, or room, that the danger signs are posted on what the
		  signs warn of.  This will allow the user to decide if they still wish to enter,
		  or if necessary go and acquire protection from the dangers, then return.
